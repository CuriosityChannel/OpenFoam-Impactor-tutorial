# OpenFoam-Impactor-tutorial
Video Tutoruials for this project is available at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tpJ7bTaS4&list=PLsNqnGDf5tT8iNXBwYbNX1UunDspERUHU

This tutorial is about "How to simulate a particulate flow in an impactor with the OpenFOAM software". The impactor geometry is created in SolidWorks and the meshing software is the OpenFOAM mesh generation tool "snappyHexMesh". Also in the final video, we will show how to view your simulation result by ParaView. You can watch the entire series on our channel.
